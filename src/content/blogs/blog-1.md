No one expects to find themselves in this situation. 

Recruiting began in early August, and there was more than enough time to find an opportunity. . . yet nothing came. Days turned into weeks, and weeks into months, and I found myself disheveled, a grief-ridden look on my face as I sat in front of a screen with hundreds of automated rejection emails stored in my archive. 

And near the end of the recruiting season, when hope was lost, and I thought it was finally all over, I was given the opportunity to partake in multiple FAANG-adjacent interviews. I studied 16 hours a day for approximately 3 weeks. Soon after receiving good feedback, however, I am given the unfortunate news that the role had been closed due to headcount being reached.

Now empty-handed, chasing after scraps as I send out hundreds of cold emails to startup founders, I find myself wondering. . . what am I going to do this summer?

Maybe I'll try starting a company.
